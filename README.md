This is a project that is being developed for Advanced Topics in Computer Science (A capstone tech course).
It involves the development of an accessible encryption application.
This project will be written in Java (backend) and C# (GUI/frontend)
A basic console prototype of some of the features that I want to implement can be found in a separate project on Dibgus's Github Page

NOTICE:
JAVA AND C# INTEROP IS ACHIEVED THROUGH A UTILITY CALLED IKVM. IF YOU WANT TO RECOMPILE THE CODE, YOU WILL HAVE TO CREATE A JAR ARTIFACT AND RUN:
ikvmc <jarfile>
You will then have to ensure that the executable is moved to the appropriate file location and has IKVM.OpenJDK.Core.dll and IKVM.Runtime.dll to be able to run.
