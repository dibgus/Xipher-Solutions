This is a project that is being developed for Advanced Topics in Computer Science (A capstone tech course).
It involves the development of an accessible encryption application.
This project will be written in C++ (backend) and Visual Basic (GUI/frontend)
A basic console prototype of some of the features that I want to implement can be found in the "prototype folder"
The prototype is written in java

NOTICE:
IN ORDER TO COMPILE A NEW DLL/EXE, YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL AND INCLUDE "CImg.h":
"git clone https://github.com/dtschump/CImg.git"
This file is used for ModSteganography within my backend code.
